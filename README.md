# Runeterra Go Client

## WIP
Basic Go Client for Legends of Runeterra's local API. It features: 

* Protobuf messages and Go tyeps for LoR domain objects.
* Parsed cards as variables and maps.
* DataDragon bundle parser for core and sets.
* Client methods for `/static-decklist` and `/positional-rectangles`.

## TODO

* Watch/poll game state via CLI
* Persist events (basic JSON)
